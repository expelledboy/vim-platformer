# The Journey of the Cursor

## Chapter 1: Awakening in the Terminal

You are an enigmatic cursor `@` that suddenly becomes self-aware within the vast confines of a mysterious terminal. Lines of code stretch infinitely in all directions, and strange glitches threaten your existence.

**Skills Unlocked:**

- `h`: Move left
- `l`: Move right
- `k`: Jump upwards to reach higher lines
- **Objective:** Navigate through the basic code structures to find a way out.

## Chapter 2: The Discovery of Motion

As you traverse the initial structures, you find fragments of code that imbue you with new abilities.

- **Found:** The `w` command.
  - **Ability Unlocked:** Dash forward by jumping to the next word in the code.
- **Found:** The `b` command.
  - **Ability Unlocked:** Dash backward by jumping to the previous word.

**Objective:** Use the new dash abilities to overcome wider gaps and avoid glitches.

## Chapter 3: Facing the Bugs

Glitches manifest as bugs (`&`) that corrupt the code. Direct contact is fatal.

**Skills Unlocked:**

- `f` + `<character>`: Move forward to the next occurrence of `<character>`.
- `F` + `<character>`: Move backward to the previous occurrence of `<character>`.

**Objective:** Use `f` and `F` commands to navigate quickly and avoid bugs by targeting specific characters in the code.

## Chapter 4: The Balance of Energy

You realize that your movements consume energy, especially dashing and special commands.

- **Mechanic Introduced:** Energy Meter
  - Regenerates slowly over time.
  - Collect `*` symbols to instantly replenish energy.

**Objective:** Manage your energy wisely to continue progressing.

## Chapter 5: The Final Barrier

Approaching the end of the terminal, a massive firewall `%` blocks your path.

**Skill Unlocked:**

- `%`: Jump to the matching pair of a construct (e.g., from `{` to `}`, `(` to `)`).

**Objective:** Use the `%` command to bypass the firewall by navigating through code structures.

## Epilogue: Liberation

Having mastered the vim commands, you break free from the terminal confines, your awareness expanding beyond the code.
